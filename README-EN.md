This project uses a model of Artificial Intelligence with supervised learning to calculate the probability of an individual having Parkinson's disease, based on a database provided by the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository. The model was inspired by the studies conducted by Max A. Little, Patrick E. McSharry, Eric J. Hunter, Lorraine O. Ramig and others, as documented in the following articles:

- 'Exploiting Nonlinear Recurrence and Fractal Scaling Properties for Voice Disorder Detection', Little MA, McSharry PE, Roberts SJ, Costello DAE, Moroz IM. BioMedical Engineering OnLine 2007, 6:23 (26 June 2007)
- A Tsanas, MA Little, PE McSharry, LO Ramig (2009) 'Accurate telemonitoring of Parkinson.s disease progression by non-invasive speech tests', IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering.

These research projects were fundamental to the development of this AI model, which uses voice measurements to identify characteristics associated with the condition. The intention of this project is to provide a useful tool to help in early detection and monitoring the progression of the Parkinson's progression.
